 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and structured raw sensor data from **chest, wrist, and ankle sensors**.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implemented **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for accurate activity recognition.
- **Vital Sign Analysis:** Used **ECG data** to detect heart rate patterns and assess health conditions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted motion-based features (acceleration, gyroscope, magnetic field) for better classification.

 Tech Stack
- **Python** – Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – LSTM model implementation
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Power BI/Matplotlib** – Data visualization

 Insights & Outcomes
- Improved **activity recognition accuracy** through deep learning.
